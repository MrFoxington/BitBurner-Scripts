The goal is to build a scipt that will be able to automate all hacking progressions from new bitnode to end.

- Build G.O.D script
    - Build Stage 1-3 scripts

- Build Foundational Scripts
    - Ram Lite scripts
        - lite_hack
        - lite_grow
        - lite_weaken
    - Rooting script
        - root all servers
            - best for income
            - best for Ram
            - remaining? (is it worth it?)

- Build Scripts for stage 1
- Build Scripts for stage 2
- Build Scripts for stage 3
